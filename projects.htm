      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>A list of projects I have worked on. Images of CTE projects are attached below.</p>
      <h3>CTE MultiMedia</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Perler beads - Using perler beads I chose to make Frisk from Undertale. Perler/fuse beads look a lot like pixel art, which is what inspired me to do that.</li>
        <li>Origami - Three different origami animals. I chose a mouse, a dove, and a crane.</li>
        <li>Laser cutter triangle - To learn how to use the laser cutter, we cut out a small triangle out of a piece of wood.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Personal</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic 3d-rendering engine - <a href="http://github.com/shandriy/rancidbirds-js">rancidbirds-js</a> - Originally meant to be a full game, I was trying to write a 3d rendering engine without using WebGL. Although it does work, due to having to paint pixel by pixel for a depth buffer in JavaScript without WebAssembly, it is incredibly slow.</li>
        <li>Top-down view collision - <a href="http://github.com/shandriy/yuri">yuri-engine</a> - Originally <i>also</i> meant for a game, but progress has mostly stopped. However the top-down view movement is mostly complete.</li>
        <li>SVG 3x2 country flags - <a href="http://github.com/shandriy/flags">flags</a></li>
        <li>Nerdle, NYT wordle with 29 letters - <a href="http://shandriy.github.io/nerd">Nerdle</a> - Yes, it actually works. Try "antidisestablishmentariansisms" or "floccinaucinihilipilification".</li>
      </ul>
