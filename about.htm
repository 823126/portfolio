      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Konstantin Edunov, I like programming and art.</p>
      <p>I was born in Russia but moved to San Francisco when I was 2, and Menlo Park a few years later, where I've lived most my life.</p>
      <p>I went to elementary school at Oak Knoll, middle school at Hillview, and am now learning at TIDE Academy.</p>
      <p>I generally enjoy programming in JavaScript although I am interested in learning Swift and Rust. Although I dislike JavaScript in lots of ways, the idea of having something anyone can access - virtually <i>all</i> operating systems have a browser - without having to recompile or have platform specific versions, is something I really like. I really enjoy focusing on backwards-compatibility to make the experience identical between browsers. JavaScript is also unique in that normally, there would be no point in minifying an interpreted language, but JavaScript gives a use to Code Golf outside of doing it just for fun which I think is really great.</p>
      <p>Outside of school, other than programming I also enjoy playing video games, mostly rhythm games such as osu!, Project SEKAI, and SOUND VOLTEX. osu! is currently my favorite game, although I also really like Hollow Knight and Undertale. I also enjoy art, although I'm not very good at it. I mostly do digital art. I put some examples below.</p>
